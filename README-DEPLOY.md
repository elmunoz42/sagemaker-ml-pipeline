# Lab Environment

In this lab, the necessary data and a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file have been pre-loaded into an Amazon S3 bucket. An Amazon SageMaker Studio instance, which provides you with a fully managed Jupyter Notebook environment, has been created and granted access to the S3 bucket. This setup allows you to seamlessly work with the provided data and notebook within the SageMaker Studio environment.

## Task 1: Set Up the Environment

In this task, you launch a SageMaker Studio application and access your lab resources.

1. Copy the `JupyterLabUrl` value to the left of these instructions.
2. Open a new browser tab and paste the `JupyterLabUrl` into the address bar.
3. Press **Enter**.
4. The browser displays the JupyterLab workspace page.

> **Note:** It might take 1â€“2 minutes for the JupyterLab workspaces interface to load for the first time.

Next, clone a Git repository and open your lab repository folder:

1. In the left menu bar, choose the **Git** icon.
2. Choose **Clone a Repository**.
3. In the **Clone Git Repository** window:
   - For **Git repository URL (.git):**, copy and paste the `CloneUrlForRepo` value listed to the left of these instructions.
   - Select the suggested URL from the dropdown menu.
   - **Caution:** Clear the **Project directory to clone into** field.
4. Choose **Clone**.
5. Wait for the repository cloning to complete.

> The SageMaker Studio environment opens the `labMLMLMRrepo` folder when the clone completes.

âœ… **Task Complete:** You have successfully launched SageMaker Studio and cloned a Git repository into the environment.

## Task 2: Create and Monitor a SageMaker Pipeline

In this task, you create and run a SageMaker pipeline, monitor the pipelineâ€™s progress, and explore some of the artifacts used or generated by the machine learning process.

1. In the left navigation pane, open the `lab_MLMLMR.ipynb` notebook.
2. In the top-right corner of the notebook page, ensure that **Python 3 (ipykernel)** is selected as the kernel.
   - If a different kernel is selected, choose the displayed kernel and then select **Python 3 (ipykernel)** from the **Select Kernel** menu.
3. Carefully advance through the `lab_MLMLMR.ipynb` notebook:
   - Run each code cell and view its output.
   - To run a cell, select within the cell and press `Shift + Enter` or choose the **Run** button at the top of the page.

When you have finished running the notebook, return here to end the lab.

âœ… **Task Complete:** You created and ran a SageMaker pipeline, monitored the pipelineâ€™s progress, and explored some of the artifacts generated by the machine learning process.
